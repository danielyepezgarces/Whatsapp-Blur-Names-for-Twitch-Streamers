Hide Whatsapp names or numbers to avoid Twitch bans for privacy.

This tool will help Streamers who are dedicated to pranking or using WhatsApp for something and want to protect themselves from Twitch rules like showing numbers or names


Next release ideas:
* Dashboard to change settings like (Enable names, Blur photos to avoid NWSF photo bans) among other things

If you have any ideas or plan to contribute with any of the above I would appreciate it :)
